# Final Year Project

## What is this project
This project is a concurrency based game environment which allows players to play multiple games of chess at once with the use of multithreading.

## What does this project do
When you run the program, you are able to choose the amount of games to play and you can also choose the player names for each game. You are then presented with X amount of games and a game status window for each game showing the move history and number of captured pieces for each player in that particular game. In the main game environment, the games of chess are shown and they are all fully functioninng games which use drag and drop mechanics to move pieces.
